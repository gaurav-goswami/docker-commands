|-----------------------------------------Docker Volume-----------------------------------------|

⭐ Docker Volume is a feature provided by docker that allows us to manage persistent data in Docker containers. When a container is created, it generally runs in an isolated environment with its own file system. However, any data stored within the container is typically non-persistent, meaning it will be lost when the container is stopped or removed. 

⭐ Docker volume provides a way to overcome this limitation by allowing us to create a separate storage area that can be shared between the containers or between the containers and the host system.

👉🏻 Create Volume
docker volume create vol-name

👉🏻 List volumes
docker volume ls

👉🏻 Inspect Volume 
docker volume inspect vol-name

👉🏻 Remove volume 
docker volume rm vol-name

👉🏻 Remove all volumes at once
docker volume prune

👉🏻 Start a container and create a volume 
docker run -d --name `container-name` -v vol-name:/path `image name` 

👉🏻 Create a read only volume after starting a container
docker run -d --name `container-name` -v vol-name:/path:ro `image name`
